Together we will work on autonomous solutions that will challenge current standards and take us into the future. With entirely new business models and advanced technology we will meet and exceed expectations from customers and contribute to a society we want to live in. We will accelerate the development, commercialization and sales of autonomous transport solutions within the Volvo Group. We combine a typical start-up\u2019s agility with the strength of belonging to the Volvo Group. \n\nThere\u2019s already about 150 of us and together we form a strong team ready to tackle the big challenges we have ahead of us. You will join our Simulation Team and our journey towards shaping a better, more sustainable future. The success of making self-driving trucks and construction machines into real operation lies in the test and data driven development, which is what our team works with.\n\nWhat will you be doing as C++ Developer?\n\nSIL testing on Perception, Decision Making as well as the entire autonomous driving software stacks including cloud-based services are more than ever crucial to enable quality, speed and safety. Thousands of scenarios running in parallel simulation instances need to be verified before production operation, some of which possibly can only be tested in simulation. In order to achieve the virtual testing ambitions, we collaborate with innovative startups, key players in AD domain like Nvidia, Foretellix on cutting edge technology development. This is where you come into the picture.\n\nYour role as a developer in the simulation team is to design and develop simulation tools which enable testing a few steps ahead of product development. Depending on the test purpose, you will customize the simulation environment in terms of virtual world, traffic scenario with various objects, configure and develop vehicle models and sensor models with different fidelity level, as well as integrated with the test automation and CI tool chain. You will interact with innovative development teams, explore test cases and provide stable test capabilities in rapid iterations. \n\nWho are you? \n\nAs we don\u2019t know you yet, we might not have everything right about your background and who you are. But when we imagine who you are, we believe you have good social skills as this job is all about collaborations. For us this means that you should be good listener, communicator and that it is easy for you to connect with other people. We also believe key competencies for this role is a positive spirit and make it happen-mindset. \n\nYou are likely a skilled software developer striving for success with creative and analytical thinking and interest in Autonomous Driving. You should also share our passion for Test Driven Development, building simulation tools, implementing testing workflows and infrastructure.\n\nYou\u2019re probably also open to work in a completely new context where we together are the motivators to make the future of automated transport solutions happen. As our business area is new you should share our curiosity for new technology, tools and way of working and want to take it to the next level.\n\nOther Key Competencies for the Position:\n\n\tMSc in Computer Science, or equivalent\n\tExperience with development of high-quality production software\n\tSkilled C++ programmer in Linux environments\n\tWide experience of real time simulations, for industry or gaming\n\tExperience in Unreal engine, Unity, OpenSceneGraph or similar 3D middleware\n\nCompetencies that we would be happy if you had:\n\n\tExperience in Carla Simulation\n\tExperience in python programming\n\tExperience with CI/CD development, Docker, GitLab, Jenkins, Ansible\n\tExperience in communication protocol, protobuf, DDS, REST API\n\tExperience in Shaders, nVidia Optix and CUDA\n\tExperience in 3D modelling for example blender, maya, 3d max\n\tKnowledge of perception sensors for autonomous driving such as lidar, radar and camera\n\tExperience from development in Robot Operating Systems (ROS) \n\nWe are actively working to establish teams that will take maximum advantage of the strength inherent to differences in knowledge, experience, age, gender and nationality, among others. We find that well balanced work teams increase group dynamics, creativity and new approaches to solutions.\n\nAre we a perfect match?\n\nWe offer you a chance to be involved in defining the future solutions within the transport industry, where we together are the motivators to make the future of automated transport solutions happen. If you love to work in the forefront of technology and can see the importance and challenges of simulation testing to achieve safe and sustainable transport solutions don\u00b4t hesitate, then you have come to the right place.
