In 2010, we decided to transform our business, resulting in a totally new generation of cars and technologies, as well as steady growth and record sales. Today, we\u2019re expanding our global footprint in Europe, China and the US, and we\u2019re on the lookout for new talent. \nWe are constantly pushing our own skills and abilities to drive change in the automobile industry like never before. We are looking for innovative, committed people to join us in this endeavour and create safe, sustainable and connected cars. We believe in the power of people and will challenge and support you to reach your full potential. Join us and be part of Volvo Cars\u2019 journey into the future.\r\n\r\nProduct Owner for Platform Software Services in future SW-centric Volvo Car\nWe imagine that our friends and family are transported in a personal, sustainable, and safe way. We visualize an environmentally friendly car that autonomously drives us to work or that it drives our children to school and that we can feel perfectly fine about it. What we build is a self-driving, fully electric, connected, and super safe Volvo Car. But the software architecture in our latest cars is complex. In fact, they are so complex that we cannot proceed with this platform to take the next level of an electric, autonomous, connected, and safe vehicle. Therefore, we build a new platform. The idea is that it will have a software-centric architecture, a built-in core computer that will run every application in the car. This new centralized signal system aims to enable scalable software architecture and continuous deployment, over-the-air data updates, and real-time decision-making for autonomous drive. \n\nAbout our R&D \u2013 Platform Software Services \nBuilding this new software-centric platform is highly prioritized and we are facing a new stage. Our department was established to take lead in the coming challenges. Our ART is newly assigned by a team of Software Engineers with both a holistic understanding of SW architecture and a commitment to details and quality code. We are responsible for governing API and application architecture for the software in the Electric Control Units. We set deliverables, frameworks, patterns, and policies that are fundamental for other development teams to build with consensus. We also act as development support by working together with teams to succeed with development and integration. \n\nWe are looking for a Product Owner in Lund \nTo succeed with our mission, we will need a Product Owner to maximize value-added work by owning and deciding upon priorities in the Team Backlog from a business perspective to streamline execution, while maintaining the technical integrity of the features/components for the team. \n\nRole Specifics\nYou will own, for example, build, prioritize, decide and refine the stories in the Team Backlog including defects and enablers and approve and sign Change Orders. It will be a responsibility of reviewing and reprioritize the backlog as part of the preparatory work for Iteration including coordination of content dependencies with other POs and all relevant stakeholders. You will draft the team\u2019s specific objectives for the upcoming program increment and participate as a member of the extended Product Management team and review and contribute to the program-level vision, roadmap, and content presentations. \n\nRequirements  \nWe believe you are a former embedded software engineer who is motivated by challenging tasks in a complex and innovative environment. Needless to say- technology and teamwork is your real passion. You enjoy learning from others, as well as, sharing your knowledge with your colleagues. You are fluent in English and can communicate effectively with all types of stakeholders. You are a social, analytical, and problem solver.  \n\u2022    M.Sc. in Electrical and/or Computer Science, Software Engineering  \n\u2022    At least 8 years of experience from working with embedded software development, committing code as well as and handling requirement within software projects \n\u2022    Experience from working on embedded software in large-scale agile software companies \n\u2022    Experience from PO, Scrum Master, and/or Managerial responsibility. \n\nMeritorious  \n\u2022    Experience within Automotive and from working in an international environment \n\nInterest and application \nWe are curious if this might be the next thing for you.
