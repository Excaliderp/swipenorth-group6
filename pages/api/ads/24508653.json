We plan new features, do investigations and research, do a lot of coding, work in pairs or mobs, review each other's work, write automated tests to ensure high quality, deploy, release and do maintenance and quick bug fixing from time to time. Last but not least, we prioritize having a lot of fun while doing all this together in a welcoming, friendly atmosphere with a lot of laughs and quirkiness.\n\nEach month our platform serves more than 6 billion ads, viewed on 500 million unique devices all over the world. This breaks down to a massive 20 000 requests and 1 GB of data transfer - per second, on average, constantly! To be able to deliver this, we have to stay in the front-line of tech development and always keep up with the latest tools and technologies. Therefore we focus a lot on continuous personal development, learning, and knowledge sharing, for example in all our cross-team forums in which we discuss challenges and findings and share knowledge and experiences. \n\nWe are now looking to strengthen our teams with more great senior backend engineers.
