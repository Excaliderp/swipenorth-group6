We provide smart tools that help put financial power back in the hands of the people - where we believe it belongs. Everything we do is based on one vision: to improve the world\u2019s financial health.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve helped Swedes and Finns save millions by refinancing expensive consumer credits. But we aim higher. New markets, new tools, new products and new ways of improving people\u2019s financial situation. This means we need more brains and hearts. More people as passionate as we are. We hope this could be you!\n\nAs a Fullstack Developer at Anyfin you will be joining a diverse and fast-paced startup environment with co-workers who are as motivated, helpful and open to change as you are. You\u2019ll be joining a team with a mix of senior, mid level and junior developers where there are a lot of possibilities both to learn and to help others by sharing your knowledge. You will be part of building something truly big from the ground up where no day will be the same.\n\nWhat you will do:\n\n- You'll be using React and Node as your main tools along with Typescript, GraphQL, Postgres and React-Native.\n- You will work on complex coding challenges, building new products and also features to our existing products.\n- You'll be working on a variety of components, from processing systems and communication gateways to our customer facing web and native apps.\n- Actively contribute to the system and product design - an open and curious mind is key.\n- You will be working in autonomous cross functional domains and be part of product and business decision making.\n- You\u2019ll be sharing knowledge, best practices and guidelines.\n\nWho you are:\n\n- You have excellent skills in JavaScript and have a clear preference for React and Node, since that is what we're heavily leaning towards.\n- We believe you have at least 3 years of professional experience. If you also have experience in react-native we would be thrilled.\n- You can find the right balance between the perfect code and what is required at the time.\n- We\u2019re building the foundations of something truly big, so it\u2019s extra important that you write clean and readable code.\n- You have an open mind and like people for what they are (yes, this belong in the formal requirements section)\n- Other relevant coding skills include Python, Go, SQL and GraphQL but are not a must.\n- It is a plus if you have been working in the financial sector and have a degree in computer science.\n\nWe\u2019re primarily looking for mid range to senior candidates from diverse backgrounds. We value a workplace where everyone is respected for who they are, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation or religion. We hope you do too :)\n\nDoes it sound interesting? Good, we are looking forward to your application!", "annonstextFormaterad": "Anyfin is a fintech company based in Stockholm.
