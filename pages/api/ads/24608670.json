Over the next two years, the School will grow significantly. The Department of Intelligent Systems and Digital Design (ISDD) at Halmstad University is seeking to appoint a senior lecturer in informatics.\n\nInformatics at Halmstad University develops the Scandinavian Informatics tradition, which integrates Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction research. We profile the research towards Digital Service Innovation (DSI). This implies a focus on how value is co-created with users, organizations, and society through combining, re-combining, and integrating resources into digital services. We also investigate how and why DSI may promote or create improvements in different societal actors' wellbeing by studying, for example, digitalization, stakeholder involvement in innovation processes, digital service logics and architectures, innovation ecosystems, and value network governance.\n\nResearch is often carried out interdisciplinary and in collaboration with companies and the public sector. The research on digital service innovation is one of the prioritized research areas where continued development of research strength is expected in order to reach excellence in international and national collaborations.
