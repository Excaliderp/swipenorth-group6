Every week around five million users enjoy SVT Play. As a growth analyst here, you will be able to help us understand those millions and to convert that into even better products.\nTHE OPPORTUNITY\nWorking within Public Service means that the focus is not primarily on generating revenue, but our goal is to improve the experience for our users. You will be instrumental in helping out building an insights-led culture. You will work tightly with both data teams in evaluating and building up data and with our development teams. Your mission will be to turn our user knowledge and data into insights, gaining a deep understanding of streaming consumption and by doing so impact our strategy of new development.\nYou will become an important part of an agile organization where we have a strong belief that the best solution is the result of collaboration and openness to new ideas. If you also enjoy working in and between cross-functional teams, you will enjoy working here!\nYOUR CHALLENGE\nYou will be given a key role working with the teams when it comes to find and score hypothesis, generate ideas for experiments including A/B-tests, setup dashboards to track the users behaviour and more. We want you to translate this analysis including strategy and business goals into KPIs and being able to come up with recommendations based on the outcome.\nWe are a small department so your footprint here is expected to be big. You\u2019ll need to have an interest in the full user journey to be able to guide and feedback into the development process where efforts will be worth most. We store our data in Google Cloud and work with SQL, Big Query and Tableau for our analysis so experience in this field is most appreciated.\nTHE TEAMS AND WORK PLACE\nAt SVT Play we are five development teams (Web, TV, Mobile, Player and Content Discovery). This position is based in the Web-team but all our analysts work together since the more the merrier and different perspectives gives better output. All teams are cross-functional and work tightly to achieve our common goals. The entire SVT Play sits together with the rest of SVT at Ga\u0308rdet, Stockholm when we are not in a pandemic.\nABOUT YOU\nYou are agile in all ways of working and we also think you are able to differentiate between what matters now and what matters later. You have strong pedagogic and presentation skills and a growth mindset. An understanding and experience of UX and editorial content will come in handy but is not a firm requirement from our side.\nSome years of working with data and insights to deliver business value is needed as well as knowledge in statistical modelling. In this role you will collaborate with many colleagues and we hope you love being in the middle and work with several products. You must be able to communicate in Swedish and in English and really like to share your knowledge with others. The most important thing, however, is your curiosity, drive and motivation to learn new things in order to do a good job. And that you are a happy camper as the rest of us.\nSO NOW WHAT?\nApply before someone else does it of course! We are evaluating the candidates continuously. For further questions you can send an email to FIRSTNAME LASTNAME (tech recruiter) at firstname.lastname at svt.se.\nIf you have union related questions, call FIRSTNAME LASTNAME (Unionen) or A\u030asa Larsdotter (Saco) on  TELEPHONENO .", "annonstextFormaterad": "SVT Play in Stockholm is now looking for another growth analyst who wants to work with one of the most used streaming products in the Nordics.
