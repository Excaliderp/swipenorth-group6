The four pillars of QT are: Quantum Computing, Quantum Simulation, Quantum Communication and Quantum Sensing. The centre is funded mainly by the Knut and FIRSTNAME LASTNAME Foundations with additional contributions from the participating universities and industry. At Chalmers, the focus is to build a superconducting quantum computer/simulator and to explore useful applications of quantum computing/simulation. At the Quantum Technology and Applied Quantum Physics laboratories we work on experimental and theoretical aspects of quantum information processing with superconducting electronics. By early 2022 we will have a transmon-based 20 qubit quantum processor available for software experimentation. As a researcher in this project, you will be closely interacting with Postdocs and PhD students in WACQT.\n\nMajor responsibilities\nDevelopment of novel quantum computing techniques for the investigation of chemical processes that show unfavorable scaling on classical computers such as the electronic structure problems of strongly correlated species, and chemical reactivity. Development of electronic structure analysis tools for chemistry studied on quantum computers.\n\nPosition summary\nFull-time temporary employment. The position is limited to a maximum of three years. \n\nQualifications\nTo qualify for the position you must have a PhD in computational physics, computational/theoretical chemistry or equivalent. Your PhD degree should generally not be older than three years. You have experience of electronic structure calculations; good programming skills; Fluency in English, oral and written; interest and skills in working collaboratively as well as independently. Expertise in quantum information science and quantum computation (e.g., using the IBM Qiskit code) and method development in quantum chemistry (e.g., coupled cluster, multi reference CI methods, or DFT) is an advantage.
