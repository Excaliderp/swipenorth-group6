The network is supported by 5 more partners, including 2 companies. The mission of the HORATES network is to use the large expertise on all aspects of hybrid and organic thermoelectrics that is available in the EU for (a) the strategic training of excellent young researchers in an emerging, interdisciplinary field and (b) the rational development of prototype energy harvesters, inspired by actual market demand.\n\nThis will happen by giving 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) exposure to a wide spectrum of expertise. In HORATES, we fuse the synthetic organic expertise with the expertise in processing and characterization to provide stable, high-performance materials and recipes for upscaling and device fabrication. Constant interaction at all stages with theory and multiscale modelling will guide the process. Crucial for the success the Programme is a multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial network, which will allow the ESR to genuinely discover and/or feed her/his attitude while having an impact on a relevant scientific and technological field. HORATES also has the mission of disseminating its scientific and technological achievements to a broad audience (scientific community, stakeholders, general public etc.).\n The HORATES network is composed by: Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg (DE), Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IT), Chalmers Tekniska H\u00f6gskola (SE), Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigationes Cientificas (ES), Link\u00f6pings Universitet (SE), Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (NL), Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz (DE), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR), University of Strasbourg (FR), Eurecat Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic (ES), Innovation Lab (DE) and Hot Disk AB (SE).\n\nDuring the programme, exchange between private sector and academia is promoted by at least one secondment per ESR with the industrial partners and beneficiaries.\n\nWe are looking for 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to be appointed at the host organisations within HORATES.
