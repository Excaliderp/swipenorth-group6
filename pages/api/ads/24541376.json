You\u2019re borderline obsessed about workflow efficiency, and you\u2019ve successfully implemented your ideas in the companies you\u2019ve worked with. Perhaps you\u2019re the kind of person that watches youtube videos on CAD for fun, or you\u2019re engaged in online communities and forums. You have a mathematical understanding about splines, and an industrial designer\u2019s sensibility to A-class surfaces. Meanwhile, you have an eagerness to learn more, and you\u2019re humble about learning from a cross-functional team.
