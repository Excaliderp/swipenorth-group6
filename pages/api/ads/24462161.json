It starts with gathering your favorite pods in one place. At the same time, we need to improve the conditions for the podcaster to create even better sections for their listeners. That's why we created Premium Podcasts. It is the pod's very best section for which the listener has to pay a small fee to access. We think it is reasonable for the podcaster to get paid for his work just like film and music creators / artists. The listener also gains from this by accessing even better podcasts and avoiding disruptive advertising breaks.\n\nWith the goal of creating the world's best podcast platform for both podcasters and podcast listeners, we want to make the podcast the best source of entertainment and learning for all types of interests. The podcast is a more active listening form than, for example, music and therefore needs its own platform, specially developed to give the listener an optimal experience, freed from disruptive advertising breaks and enriched with more interactivity, content and quality.\n\nWe, the creators of PodMe, are big consumers of podcasts and admirers of all the creative and talented people who struggle every day to give their listeners the best possible entertainment. We work purposefully and passionately every day to develop and fill PodMe with more talented podcasters, more unique sections and other added values.\n\nWelcome to PodMe.\n\nABOUT PINETREE\n\nAt Pinetree we have a vision and mission to differentiate ourselves from the crowd and are Sweden's challengers in talent search and matching.\n\nBy working as an agency, the value to you as a employee is that we have a very wide network of partner companies that we continuously ensure quality.", "annonstextFormaterad": "Want to join an exciting journey and change the world of podcasts?\n\nThe vision is that PodMe should be as natural as with a premium service in music and film (Spotify, Netflix)\n\n\n\nOFFER\n\nYou will have the opportunity to participate in a development journey where you work to develop and create a platform that gives more people access to an outstanding podcast experience.
